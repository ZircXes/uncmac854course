# UNC Kenan-Flagler MAC 854
UNC MAC 854: Data Analytics for Accountants

### The repository is organized by folders as follows:
1. overview: Course Overview and Instructor Bio
2. toolbox: Course tools and getting started
3. Weeks 01 - 05: course python supplemental material
4. assignments: Optional python assignments

### This repository includes basic python code which provides an introduction to the following packages and concepts:
1. Manipulating data with Pandas and Numpy
2. Statistics with scipy.stats
3. Linear and Logistic regression with SKLearn
4. Regularization (basic)
5. Decision and Classification trees
6. Databases and SQL with SQLite3

The approaches here are targeted towards a non-quant, non-data scientist with an interest in learning these techniques in Python as opposed to SAS JMP, SAS, EXCEL, or MS Access. Additionally, modern systems will not use Excel or MS Access and will likely be embedded in Python, SAS, or R.

This is a 5-week introductory course, so we don't have time to cover advanced topics such as performance metrics (beyond confusion matrices), cross-validation, performance monitoring, neural networks, support vector machines, advanced feature selection, PCA, and unsupervised learning or unclassified data learning.

Traditionally we focused on a statistics approach to linear regression (p-values); however, these Python codes are starting to push towards cross-validation as opposed to relying on p-values or information theory criterion for feature selection.

For additional Python machine learning resources, please see the excellent book (and GitHub page) by Aurélien Géron at https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2.

### Software to follow along
1. Anaconda with either Jupyter or Spyder:
   * Jupyter Notebook (Interactive Python Notebook)
   * Spyder (GUI + Console)

### To Dos
The scripts were thrown together quickly, so there are some significant re-factoring opportunties that I plan to get to. Also planning to migrate the scripted python code to cleaner Jupyter Notebooks.
