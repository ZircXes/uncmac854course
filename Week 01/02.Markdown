# Introduction to Markdown (.md) and reStructured Text (RST)
Rich text formats are lightweight and designed for the quick writing of inline styles without requiring a formal word processor. We use "Markdown" in Jupyter Notebooks to provide inline rich text.

Advanced python documentation utilities may also use Markdown or ReStructured Text (RST). RST is slightly more complex than markdown and is not required for this course, but I include it for completeness as it is used in auto-documentation utilities such as Sphinx.

Key formats you will want from markdown to use it quickly are:
* Headings
* Lists
* Bold/Italics
* Links
* Inline code and Block code styles
