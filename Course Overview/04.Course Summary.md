# MAC 854 Course Summary

## Course Objectives
We are not going to turn you into a data scientist in five weeks.
1. Use one of the techniques over these 5 weeks to build a proof-of-concept to obtain additional resources (*e.g. vendor, internal data science team, hire*)
2. Understand the business and accounting ramifications of models to ask the right non-technical questions to challenge data science models built by others

### Course Concepts by Week
1. Statistics (basic refresher)
2. Linear Regression and Information Value
3. Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Classification Trees
4. Data manipulation with SQL, SQLite databases, and data standards
5. Data visualization with Matplotlib

#### Notes: 
* Non-python materials for the course rely on non-python tools (Excel, MS Access, Tableau, SAS JMP, etc.)
* Python materials include machine learning basic concepts (e.g. regularization, cross-validation and hyperparameters, pipelines, one-hot encoding, etc.)
* Course does not cover the cloud; however, I may add that material in the future

### Other courses on Github by this instructor
* MBA705: https://github.com/ZircXes/unmba705course/ (under construction but almost done)
* MBA700 (under construction): (not yet on github) (ignoring YAGNI and putting in this placeholder)
