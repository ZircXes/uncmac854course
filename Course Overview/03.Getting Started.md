# Getting Started with Python

Optional content to use Python with MAC 854. Python is not required to complete this course; however, the materials are available for advanced users or users wishing to use modern programming tools to complete similar tasks.

Modern data science approaches are almost fully in either "Python" or "R." Enterprises solutions may also include SAS, which is a proprietary traditional statistical language.

Given some nuanced advantages for "Python" over "R", including package management, and cross-over with application development, my preference is to introduce you to Python.


#### Python version
We will use Python 3.x as opposed to 2.x. 


#### Platform for Python Development
My recommendation is a combination of **Jupyter Notebook** and **Spyder**, both which come with the **Anaconda** software package.

Note: Enterprise solutions are likely going to use an IDE such as PyCharm or Eclipse, sitting on a compute cluster running Apache Spark or something similar (using pyspark). 
The main differences in these environments are:
* The Python editor
* Linting / auto-formatting (e.g. Python Black)
* Computational resources available (scalable by compute and memory (CPU/RAM))
* Scheduling for compute resources and automated processes
* Data access requirements for read/write/tables
* Libraries/packages specific to the resource (e.g. pyspark)
* Package management (e.g. artifactory or jfrog)


#### GitHub Page
Python specific materials are available on the course Github page. The UNC course platform makes it a little tricky to add additional/optional content, so my regular materials will be maintained in detail at:

#### Primary Course Libraries and Packages
* Pandas "pd"
* Numpy "np"
* Sci-Kit Learn "sklearn"
* Lite SQL Database "sqlite3"
* Regular expressions "re" 

#### Installing extra packages
You can use the Anaconda interface to install new packages, but many libraries are not built into anaconda default channels so instead of *conda* you may have to run the Anaconda console and use `pip install` *package_name*
